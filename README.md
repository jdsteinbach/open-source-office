# Open Source Office

I'm "open sourcing" my home office design / decor. I know I'd welcome tips, tricks, ideas & resources, and I bet others who are setting up a home office would appreciate them as well.

## Contributing

For now, let's use issues for suggestions, ideas & contributions.

1. Check to see if there's [already an issue](https://github.com/jdsteinbach/open-source-office/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) about your topic. For example, if you're recommending the same standing desk that an issue exists for, just comment on that issue. If there's already an issue comparing various USB chargers, add your favorite there, not to a new issue.
2. If you open a [new issue](https://github.com/jdsteinbach/open-source-office/issues/new), add the appropriate [label](https://github.com/jdsteinbach/open-source-office/labels) to it.
3. Please include links to recommended purchases / tutorials and, whenever possible, add an image of the product or result.
4. Let's not go nuts on referral links, ok? :smile: The goal here is to help each other, not pad our Amazon credit.

## Moderation

Since this is my repo, I'll moderate any complaints or abuses. If things get big, I'll add some official contributors/moderators.
